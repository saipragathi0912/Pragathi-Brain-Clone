I think almost everyone knows what a Brownian Motion is. I got to know about it first when I was in my 12th Standard as part of my Chemistry syllabus. The hatred towards the subject didn't do much of a help ðŸ˜…

### History

An interesting fact about Mathematics is, that there are some significant discoveries in the field that actually originated from a completely different background. This is one of such cases. A respected botanist called Robert Brown originated this theory when he was trying to prove that all materials are made up of molecules. Then a respected Computer Scientist and Mathematician called Nobert Wiener added mathematical rigour to Dr. Brown's theory. 

### Mathematical Explanation 

Brownian Motion comes under a class of Stochastic Process.
