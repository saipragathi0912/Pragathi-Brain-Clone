The general notion of change doesn't excite people. It used to be scary as hell for me. Change in place, change in one's behaviour, etc. I am still in process, but at a much better state than before. The whole concept got exciting once I realised it's connected to uncertainty. Being an avid overthinker, the amount of possibilities you can think about and guess what can happen at what rate. Sounded very fascinating to me. 


Understanding change also helped me achieve emotional independence. Or I can say it goes both ways as well. Imagine Life as a Markovian process where your future is only gonna depend on the present. And visualise it as a graph with highs and lows just like a stock index. The actions taken at this instant will make a transition from one state to another. It's important to enjoy this process and not let other's change affect you in any way. 

  

I thought about interpreting change in a different perspective, but I changed my mind 😝. Have fun people 😌
