Makemore is a tool/program that generates more of what we give. Here, a names dataset (consisting of 32k names) was used with intention to produce more unique names. To start with, a bigram model is being put to use. 
A bigram model is a language model that learns all pairs of occurrences of letters to predict the next letter. 
Key takeaways:

1. Extraction of Bigrams from the given dataset
2. Visualisation of the bigrams
3. Generation of text using a bigram model
4. Broadcasting of the tensors (Need to practise more of this, can lead to a lot of bugs if not implemented properly)
5. Understanding how loss functions can be used to evaluate the working of the bigram model
6. Introduction to neural networks
