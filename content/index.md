## My Introduction

I highly appreciate the efforts to open this page and check what this lil one's upto. Documenting my whole journey is something I've been planning for a long time, and this is an outcome along the process. Keeping the uncertainty of it's success in mind, planning to put consistent efforts without any expectations. Alter ego is the person I want myself to be, and whatever content pushed here will be a record of my efforts and outcomes towards its convergence. Let's see how this goes. All I can say is, it's gonna be fun and a lil nerdy along the way. 

If any of my opinion or content seems inconsistent, please reach out to me. I love to improve myself in whatever aspect there is.

This section starts with all the basics and then hopefully dives into the course.
